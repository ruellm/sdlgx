cmd_dialogline	2/3/0/Red/0.5/I swear this has nothing to do with--;

cmd_dialogline	0/16/0/Tom/0.5/I agree. Not sayin that you are.;
cmd_dialogline	0/10/0/Tom/0.5/ Just give me a quick explanation as to why\n you have these.;
cmd_wait;

cmd_dialogline	2/3/0/Red/0.5/5 days ago, I had a box delivered to my house, it was unmarked.\n I thought it was a mistake but then no one came to take it back.;
cmd_wait;

cmd_dialogline	2/3/0/Red/0.5/After a while, when we noticed that no one was coming to take it back,\n we opened It and found apricots  and peaches.;
cmd_wait;

cmd_dialogline	2/3/0/Red/0.5/We were happy for a bit, until we noticed that it was too much, and we\n could not finish them all before they were gonna get rotten.;
cmd_wait;

cmd_dialogline	2/3/0/Red/0.5/So we passed them around our neighborhood, our dad brought them to\n work, and I brought them to school to eat too.;
cmd_wait;

cmd_dialogline	1/11/0/Emma/0.5/Hmmm, seems a bit farfetched.;
cmd_wait;

cmd_dialogline	2/3/0/Red/0.5/This is the slip that was sent with the mail. Addressed to me, but didn't\n come with a sender.;

cmd_dialogline	1/11/0/Emma/0.5/That is so strange, to have sent you a billion pieces of fruit like that.\n It's almost like you were predicted to bring it here and be set up.;
cmd_wait;

cmd_dialogline	2/3/0/Red/0.5/Yes. My thoughts exactly.;
